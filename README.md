A modern React-based tool for validating and managing workflow queues with real-time updates and interactive visualizations.

## Features

- **Real-time Queue Monitoring**: Track active, waiting, completed, and failed jobs across multiple workflow stages
- **Company-Centric View**: Group jobs by company and view their progress through the workflow
- **Interactive Workflow Diagram**: Visualize the entire workflow process with job counts
- **Detailed Job Inspection**: Examine job details, data, and logs in a user-friendly interface
- **Job Management**: Approve, retry, or manage jobs directly from the dashboard

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript
- **UI Components**: Custom components with Tailwind CSS
- **State Management**: RxJS for reactive state management
- **API Communication**: Axios for HTTP requests
- **Data Fetching**: SWR for data fetching with caching and revalidation
- **Containerization**: Docker for deployment
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes for container orchestration

## RxJS Architecture

This project uses RxJS for reactive data processing and state management. The application follows a reactive programming paradigm where data flows through streams (Observables) that can be transformed, combined, and consumed.

Key aspects of our RxJS implementation:

- **Reactive Data Flow**: Data flows through streams from API to UI
- **Centralized State Management**: Using BehaviorSubjects in QueueStore
- **Non-blocking Operations**: All data processing is asynchronous
- **Declarative Transformations**: Using operators like map, filter, mergeMap

For detailed information about our RxJS implementation and best practices, see [RxJS-GUIDE.md](./RxJS-GUIDE.md).
